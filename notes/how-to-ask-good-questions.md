# How to ask good questions (that produce good answers)

A good question reduces ambiguity. It’s not about being verbose — it’s about being *well-posed*.

## The minimum template

1. **Goal:** what are you trying to decide or understand?
2. **Context:** what’s already known / assumed?
3. **Constraints:** time, budget, tools, level of rigor, audience.
4. **Output format:** bullets, derivation, code, steps, links.

## The “hidden premise” detector

If answers are wildly different, the question is likely missing a premise.
A quick fix is to add one line:

> Assume X. If X is false, tell me what changes.

## Ask for uncertainty explicitly

When the world is noisy:

- ask for **ranges**,
- ask for **assumptions**,
- ask what would **change your mind**.

## My personal bias

If you want the rigorous version, say so.
I’ll trade speed for clarity: definitions → claims → evidence.
