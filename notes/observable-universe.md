# Observable universe (no mysticism)

The **observable universe** is not “everything that exists”. It’s everything that can have had time to affect us *since the Big Bang*, given the finite speed of light and the expansion history of space.

## Two different horizons people mix up

- **Particle horizon:** the farthest distance light could have traveled to reach us since the beginning.
- **Event horizon (cosmological):** a boundary beyond which events will *never* be able to affect us, even in infinite future (depends on dark energy / expansion).

## Why the observable universe is larger than 13.8 billion light-years

The universe is ~13.8 billion years old, but while light was traveling, **space expanded**. So the *current* proper distance to the matter that emitted the oldest light we see (CMB) is ~46 billion light-years.

## What it does *not* imply

- It does **not** imply the universe ends at that boundary.
- It does **not** imply there is a center with us at it.

## A clean takeaway

“Observable” is a statement about **causal accessibility**, not ontology.
