# Welcome to the Starlibrary

This is a deliberately small experiment.

- The format is plain Markdown.
- The output is plain HTML.

## Why

I want a place where knowledge is *browseable*.

When a conversation yields something reusable (a definition, a method, a diagram-in-words), it deserves a stable shelf.

## A tiny code block

```python
print('hello, universe')
```
